# Super-Resolution-Nuclei-Segmentation
* This code is rewritten based on the following paper for the use of the code: Mela CA, Liu Y. Application of convolutional neural networks towards nuclei segmentation in localization-based super-resolution fluorescence microscopy images. BMC Bioinformatics, 2021; 22, 325.

* We optimized CNN-based nuclei segmentation for single-molecule localization-based (e.g., STORM or PALM) super-resolution images.
